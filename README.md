Convey messages without being noticed using Zero Width Characters, which are special Unicode characters that do not occupy any visible space and cannot be highlighted. These characters are typically utilized to separate abstract foreign languages, and some websites use them for their user interface.

H!dd3n is a Chrome extension, you can encode any message using zero width spaces, abbreviated (ZWSP) and send them to anyone you want without anyone else being able to read them. You can also receive encode messages from other h!dd3n users and decrypt them right in your browser which can be inserted almost anywhere without being seen.

H!dd3n also allows you to convert message when checkbox is ticked to l33t sp34k so message is noticeable for recipient to decode. When checkbox unticked the Public Message is shown in same format that user input into Public Message box.

Button Features:

H!D3 button: When clicked, it retrieves the values of the "public-message" and "private-message" text areas, encodes the private message using a binary encoding scheme, and then appends the encoded message to the "encoded-message" text area.

SH0W button: When clicked, it retrieves the value of the "encoded-message" text area, decodes the hidden private message from the encoded message, and then sets the value of the "private-message" text area to the decoded message.

COPY button: When clicked, it reads the value of the "encoded-message" text area and copies it to the clipboard.

P4ST3 button: When clicked, it reads the value from the clipboard and sets it as the value of the "encoded-message" text area.
